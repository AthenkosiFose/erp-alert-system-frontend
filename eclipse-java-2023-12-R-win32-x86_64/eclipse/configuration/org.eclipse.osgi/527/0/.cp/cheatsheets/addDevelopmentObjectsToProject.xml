      <intro>
         This tutorial demonstrates step by step how to add new development objects to your project using the <b>ABAP Development Tools</b>. 
<br/>
You will also discover that this procedure is a bit different, depending on the object type to be created. Currently, you can create certain development objects such as DDIC tables, structures, or data elements, solely by means of GUI-based tools. <br/>
<br/>   
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to: 
<br/>
&gt; Create regular and exception ABAP classes
<br/>
&gt; Create ABAP programs 
<br/>
&gt; Assign a transport request
<br/>
&gt; Create further development objects such as ABAP Dictionary data elements 
<br/>
&gt; Understand the interplay between Eclipse-based and GUI-based tools.

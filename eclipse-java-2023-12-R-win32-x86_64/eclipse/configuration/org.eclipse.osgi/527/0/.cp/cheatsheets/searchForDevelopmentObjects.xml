      <description>
         Imagine you want to use the functionality of a global ABAP class. However, you do not know the exact name of the class nor do you have any documentation for it. In such cases, simply use the global search and where-used functions in ABAP Development Tools.  
<br/>
<br/>
This cheat sheet shows you how to carry out a <b>global search</b> for any development object <b>in an ABAP system</b>.  
<br/>
<br/>
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
<br/>
&gt; Perform a system-wide search for ABAP development objects 
<br/>
&gt; Get the Where-Used-List for ABAP classes
<br/>
&gt; Get the Where-Used-List for their subobjects, such as methods
<br/>
&gt; Restrict the scope of your search.
